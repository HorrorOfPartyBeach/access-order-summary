# Access Order Summary

This project was built for a tech test. The time I had free to focus on this was limited so not all of the requirements were completed.

The requirements are listed below:

### Objective

Your challenge is to build out an order summary screen using React and Tailwind with some design in the browser improvisation.

### Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Change the plan between an Annual & Monthly Plan
- Process a fake payment
- Cancel the order to display a list of products
- Good clean code

### Assumptions

- The site is a mock-up focusing on the front end so it is fine to hardcode data
- The end result will look as close to the designs as possible
- You will use tailwind utility classes and a custom global config to achieve the styling
- While there are no designs for the payment and product listing options, this should be improvised to meet the requirements

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm tw:build`

Launches the Tailwindcss CLI build process
See the section about [Getting Started with Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for more information.

The build process occurs when you make changes to Tailwind utility classes.

### `npm start:tw`

Runs the app in development mode and launches the Tailwindcss CLI build process

## Future Improvements

If I was to add to this project in future, I would do the following:

- Add unit tests for components (Jest and React Testing Library)
- Add additional accessibility improvements and test thoroughly for accessibility criteria
- Add automated accessibility testing with a plugin such as cypress-axe or jest-axe
- Further refactor components to be more generic and reusable
